### What is ERSA?
ERSA stands for Earthquake Resilient Structure Analysis. The main aim of ERSA is to
determine the structural integrity of buildings, and hence provide means to increase it and take
further action.

### Goals
Lately, we have been seeing news of earthquakes and their devastation. Wouldn't it be helpful
for everyone if they could have an understanding of the structural integrity of their buildings
and possible ways to retrofit them? This is what ERSA aims to achieve. Using data provided by
the user, we can make an analysis about the stability of their building and methods to improve
it. Doing so would greatly aid society, especially people in earthquake prone areas. This project
is based on the seismic zone classification of geographic locations in India, hence is most
accurate for Indian regions. Such a functionality has not been implemented before, especially
for countries like India. This app, which is easy to use, would greatly aid the people of India.
### Tech Stack used
Front end: React.js
Back end: Python (flask framework), along with Tensorflow and Keras.
